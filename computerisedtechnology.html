    ">  Computerised Technology refers to inventions that are linked with computers with a CPU(Central processing units ) with some hardware and some software programs such as excel, window and microsoft office. Also there is  some secondary storage to contain all the algorithms and protocols for the computerised Technology  this could be a general purpose computer with lots of functions such as watching a film and at the same time playing a game. to make devices to work like a CD and DVD player.However they may be different  types of computer such as:
                    <br><br>

                    Information and communication technology(ICT)
                    Personal device
                    Input devices
                    Output devices
                    1 The information and communication technology are computerised technology that are interconnected between each other and used to copy data, modify data and to create data. Also, they could be used for telephone, transactions machine,world web site, and office equipment like printer
                    2 may include computerised technology  that you own and is personal for you for your work or images etc but is owned by you  these may laptop,tablet,phone,external drive etc
                    3 video audio  cards usbs hubs SD cards Hard drive also this are used between communication like calling messaging and telephoning.
                    4 These  are devices that allow you to give input into the software and then give a result.
                    5 these outputs  give the outputs of the process

                            A Computerised Technology  is  any invention  or device with some hardware,  some software,  input and output devices.In the GCSE TEXTBOOK COMPUTER SCIENCE OCR it basically says “that a computer consists of main memory, secondary storage, processor, input and output devices.However, not all computerised technology require secondary storage,For example:  fingerprint, detection, camera and voice control etc.

                                        According to my other resource(my computer teacher)he said
                                        “Most modern definitions have Artificial Intelligence as being computer based.  However, if an algorithm was not computer based and was well written I would expect that it too could be counted as artificially intelligent, but it would still be dependent on someone to read it and act upon it.”
                                        To Summarise any artificial intelligence is a computerised technology according to my teacher.  People may say that  this bias because some perspectives could be different and be false but I have known my teacher for a long time and believe that he is accurately giving me facts. So For artificial intelligence I have counted this as a computerised technology.
