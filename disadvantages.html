                    Nhs being hacked
                    Should be secure
                    This should be Computerised being an disadvantage in general and not in the police force.
                    However and possible solution to say what were  the problems and how they as an company made a solution to never let this happen again
                    As this is from an Government website this shows that this website may not be as it seems.so he website itself will have to make the website more advance by using better encryption and making the website more secure and then this as an problem of being hacked decrease however as I have l learn from the university of London and IBM online course on cyber security there will never be 100 percent security it is like this if someone who can get into anyone bank even if he bank had security guard he robber will still be able to go and steal all the money still so we know that is never gonna be 100% secure but we can increase the number so that it is so unlucky that he website will be hacked again.

                    <br />
                    <br />






                    Government organisation(Bedfordshire police force ) was hacked  in 2008
                    This shows how the government organisation did not have enough cyber security to prevent this hack. Unfortunately the disadvantage is that there is always a probability of being hacked. There is no solution to solve this problem  unless there is a way but right now we do not have the technology or the knowledge and intelligence to solve this disadvantage.
                    Disadvantage:
                    Police misused his computerised technology to stalk people
                    Nearly everywhere people will unfortunately misuse he power even the Kings and queens have done this stuff and other sections of people have done this
                    This may be argued that this is not an disadvantages Of computerised technology as people misuse their power all the time and that is the only problem.
                    The solution to this is that there they constantly look at everyone on what they do and do more vetting and security call
                    After doing more research, according  to the police officer I have interviewed, they said that will always happen and the only thing they can do is that they can find them and then stop them from doing real damage as fast as possible.
                    Disadvantage:
                    Same disadvantage but more recent.
                    Maybe an Possible solution is that they constantly look at everyone on what they do and do more vetting and security
                    the disadvantage
                    the police force was arrested due to misusing the data
                    the research solution is to add more surveillance and technology to monitor police misusing their power and technology
                    the disadvantage that I got was that to misuse the computerised technology you need to have a bad behavioural approach to misuse any computerised technology this means if the bad person gets the computerised technology they could misuse this. This  was the main problem to solve:
                    To solve this:research solution is to add more surveillance and technology/computer systems such as body cameras and recorder to record dialog and computer monitor software  to monitor police misusing their power and technology
                    the Disadvantage:


                    <br />                <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />




                    The expensiveness this may be accurately correct because technology becomes expensive, such as the iphone being £100- to more than £1000 pound
                    The solution to this is that  they get more funding and recently  the UK government has increased the budget to 7% and this should help them slightly deal with this tough disadvantage .
                    Some need technician because they were very complex and I do agree with this because running a client to server you need technician to do make the client to server work(my work)
                    Front cameras alone cost $45000 which may be too expensive and I think that they should be cheaper.
                    This computer always changes and becomes more complex everyday that even the specialist has to become specialist again this looks fairly right because technology is always changing
                    doorbells are used to see where crimes are and to be able to detect the place so police can come, which is very good, however one possible disadvantage is that  they may use it to hunt you down and the police may get you kidnapped if the police officer is evil.
                    These can be used to put a bad image or blackmail you if they can get access to misuse you.
                    the research solution is to add more surveillance and technology to monitor police misusing their power and technology
                    This was also used when riots were made in 2020 which is very good but if someone can change the image to show a different perspective and accuse wrong people.
                    Unfortunately there is no solution to this if this ever happens because you are not always gonna have 100% cyber security but we can increase security by using protocols such as strong password secure websites and firewalls and not to download or press any html in the phishing..

                    As well as the lie detector which is used for detecting, however if the person is scared and says the truth the lie detector says he is lying so this is not an advantage but more as a disadvantage.
                    Another advantage is that they can be used in dangerous times and places however whenever the robots have AI there are theories that they will attack us and destroy us and if this is true then this is a massive disadvantage but we do not know
                    They can also be used for surveillance and protecting places however if someone gets access to this they can be misused to do the opposite job and be a very negative side effect which the websites do not say.
                    The software that is very good at tackling crime is ShotSpotter, not fake after researching on the internet.
                    Another genius computer system is the Digital Twins this shows real world map and is basically tracks any suspicious acts  or potential threats however, this was discover in China so they may be some bias because this is not in USA or England so they may be some inaccurate because if this is so good how come it is not in the UK police force or USA  police force this give some question to this? According to the research on the internet, the use of digital twins is soon gonna be used.
                    that VR and AR which is virtual reality and augmented reality which is used to train police officers much more easily however, if these computer systems are changed or do not have proper algorithms then this will be bad because police will not act like they should possibly
                    he Met spend about £250 million pound on computerised technology
                    This is not really a disadvantage but I would like to add some extra information they clearly don’t know how to use the money efficiently such as buying better gadget but they improve the older technology by fixing them instead a possible solution this I think is that they recycle it and get the money or trade in for a lot of money.but due to me not knowing enough this solution may not be as accurate
                    poor ICT prevents police officers  completing their job at a normal pace.

                    <br />


                    why computerised technology is a way to advance for the police which is a disadvantage.
                    Some Extra information which is reliable if not up to date with computerised technology this may be the reason of some of the disadvantages of computerised technology
                    Police officers personally believe that computerised technology is holding them back.
                    poor technology basically stops all the possible advantages of saving time to wasting time such as logging for 30 mins but a phone will take only a couple minutes. and tracking criminals and where crime is happening will take longer due to the poor technology.
                    Another disadvantage we can have as before is the threat of cyber crimes and due to poor technology,it will be harder to stop these cyber crimes or detect them.
                    there is a risk of computerised technology being reduced
                    met has apparently said there is a numbers of ICT Problems but unfortunately did not say why
                    Only solution to this is buy and use the money more efficient to get new computerised technology and that they will be no problem for old computer based technology
                    Some of the disadvantages are that they can use the technology too long which may distract and slow down the efficiency and productivity of the police force work. And this disadvantage we have seen over and over again
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To Conclude the use of computerised technology will always have disadvantages however the advantages always beat the disadvantages and that we can find solution to disadvantages but there is no final solution to stop all disadvantages and they will always have a disadvantage but again the use of computerised technology is way better than the disadvantages.
