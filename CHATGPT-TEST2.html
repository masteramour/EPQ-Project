                The advantages of using computerised technology
The software can make a database which can be used in the future to identify any historical data  ,it is also a security feature for the police force by making any confidential data to be confidential.
It allows them to contact and communicate with other people much more quickly. They can save my money by making specific deals with clouds.
It says that the software has a specific security that can prevent cyber security and that it still isn’t 100% secure. . This could also be saved many times because it can detect and track someone quickly however, this may be bad because it can be misused to look at people and stalk them. 
that saves time by using technology to write document and controls large amount of data that is ready to be use  
Also this can be used to send data faster.

An advantage is that the police force use investigation software which can be used to help them investigate, detect and see what happened in the crime scene, however we will never know the true intention on why some did a crime. Computerised technology does not help with this, so this may just be a disadvantage. 
The is no solution is because no computer can understand someone brain or know there intentions 
One final type of police software we can talk about is facial recognition because the advantage is that they can detect people but the disadvantage is how they can tell between twins. This may be solved in the future and this may become a better advantage than disadvantage.
Some of the advantages was that it was used to control reapplication and find out where crimes are happening and used to detect people who stole cars. However the police force misuse this. This is because they used  the used the sporting car job with the computerised technology and did just this while they had much more important jobs also they misuse this by giving the police the wrong place to go which, allows criminals to do what they want and maybe never ever being caught however, another good advantage is that they could organise the police force but again the police force would have been lazy and did not do the important task. 

<br><br><br>
<h1>Some other advantages<h1> 
To provide data and make a good relationship between the public and the police. 
Discover crime and allow police to go there. 
Reduce time of labour.




Used a website to introduce the police force, show jobs, show people who wanted etc. This is also very good however, 
Computer Improves the minor crimes by detecting them much more quickly and alerting the police force much more faster
 
Computer technology Increased crime clearance rate by 8% and also in 1990 only 100 people in the police force of America which was 2%  had computerised technology but in the 2000s they were more than 40% that had the police force.
This shows that computerised technology has significantly have helped the america police force in reducing crime and clearing crime however you  could only used computerised technology if you used it an advantages 
some of usage is that they used social media for Information,Research and see if there is any wanted person or thing such as the PDF gave information that in 2012 they posted a lost dog and that they received more than 50 000 replies on where the dog was and this meant the dog was found, this is  because when looking at social media you pay more attention compared to looking at a post in the town which you may not take heed a lot and that the lost animal could be in different area.

Another is that police can detect crimes much faster because if police post some post about someone one wanted or a crime scene they  can find if there is any crime and if so this will be easier to prevent again. 

   <br><br><br>

<h1>Some of the advantages were:<h1>
Digital policing will allow the public to speak more easily with the police 
Transfer data much more quickly which may be vitale such as a car interception 
This has made the community safe 

Due to increasing amount of computerised technology police have been able to perform drug test ,alcohol test and I agree with this statement this is because I  used to watch police interception using these drug test which has been very vitale to prove that they broken the law however if this machine have an error this will be very unjust because the person did not have any alcohol so they may be  some bias also this has allowed criminal and victims to receive justice.
Save time by allowing the computerised technology to eliminate the time. Allowing police to do more community service . 400 000 thousands hour by changing pen to paper into a phone with important information however we unfortunately do not know how much time was save because how would you measure the time

The ANPR has very  good computerised technology by detecting the plate number of the car.
With the help of AI the police force can make the country safer


Computerised technology increases productivity by decreasing the amount of officers needed for the same amount of work which I agree is a very good advantage and we have seen this advantage before.

Also computerised technology helps police force to target the crime and give in the right resources as we can see we have seen this before this advantage.
 if we can use a more efficient way of using the money for computerised technology we can then use this for getting the advantage of using computerised technology


<br><br><br>


<h1>Final advantages of using computerised technology in police force<h1> 
IF the IT Strategies are successful then we can reduce crime,support the victims and have better communication with the public..
 another advantage I have seen is that mobile devices now allow knowledge to come to the hand in a matter of seconds
Computerised technology increases productivity by decreasing the amount of officers needed for the same amount of work which I agree is a very good advantage and we have seen this advantage before.
the time and the location and even predict a criminal activity which will massively save time by allowing them to go to the location and know when it is happening.
the computerised technology can increase the efficiency and productivity of the police force
somehow the computerised technology deters the criminal activity  
there is places you can report crime online instead of going to the police station
The computerised technology automates some of the tasks of the police force which saves time and allows the police force to do something else.
another advantage is that we can use computerised technology to identify the future risk using computerised modelling
 social media we can identify the crime much faster and go to the crime scene much faster as we will know the location
We can use fingerprints and cameras to identify the suspects and see what actually happens but if someone hacked the computer then we can not do anything until we find it as being hacked because there is no solution to this.
