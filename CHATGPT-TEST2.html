                    The advantages of using computerised technology
                    The 8 benefits are that the software can make a database which can be used in the future to identify any historical data  ,it is also a security feature for the police force by making any confidential data to be confidential.
                    It allows them to contact and communicate with other people much more quickly. They can save my money by making specific deals with clouds.
                    It says that the software has a specific security that can prevent cyber security and that it still isn’t 100% secure. . This could also be saved many times because it can detect and track someone quickly however, this may be bad because it can be misused to look at people and stalk them and this website did not say this. This may be biassed.
                    that saves time by using technology to write document and controls large amount of data that is ready to be use
                    Also this can be used to send data faster.
                    The advantage
                    An advantage is that the police force use investigation software which can be used to help them investigate, detect and see what happened in the crime scene, however we will never know the true intention on why some did a crime. Computerised technology does not help with this, so this may just be a disadvantage.
                    The is no solution is because no computer can understand someone brain or know there intentions
                    One final type of police software we can talk about is facial recognition because the advantage is that they can detect people but the disadvantage is how they can tell between twins. This may be solved in the future and this may become a better advantage than disadvantage.
                    Advantage
                    Some of the advantages was that it was used to control reapplication and find out where crimes are happening and used to detect people who stole cars. However the police force misuse this. This is because they used  the used the sporting car job with the computerised technology and did just this while they had much more important jobs also they misuse this by giving the police the wrong place to go which, allows criminals to do what they want and maybe never ever being caught however, another good advantage is that they could organise the police force but again the police force would have been lazy and did not do the important task. A final disadvantage that I got was that to misuse the computerised technology you need to have a bad behavioural approach to misuse any computerised technology this means if the bad person gets the computerised technology they could misuse this. This  was the main problem to solve:
                    To solve this:research solution is to add more surveillance and technology/computer systems such as body cameras and recorder to record dialog and computer monitor software  to monitor police misusing their power and technology
                    Some of the advantages are:
                    They were used to save time and to store all confidential data secretly.
                    To store enormous amounts of data.
                    To reduce crime,disorder,fear of crime by allocating them to specific places at important times.
                    To provide data and make a good relationship between the public and the police.
                    Discover crime and allow police to go there.
                    Reduce time of labour.
                    They are used to store lots of information. This may be a disadvantage  because some still can access this by cyber attack and use this to blackmail or misuse this powerful data.
                    <br />                <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    If someone steals this then they have the power to misuse and take this as guaranteed
                    This can also show experience by videos however if someone access this they can change to show bad image of police and why police is a terrible indignant job
                    Also IT can be used to organise documents much faster.
                    Used a website to introduce the police force, show jobs, show people who wanted etc. This is also very good however, they are always the criticism such as someone can access this they can delete jobs and show a bad image and put off other people wanted who they dislike so they can blackmail them and do more crime and that they can also used this to blackmail the police force
                    Computer Improves the minor crimes by detecting them much more quickly and alerting the police force much more faster
                    Computer technology Increased crime clearance rate by 8% and also in 1990 only 100 people in the police force of America which was 2%  had computerised technology but in the 2000s they were more than 40% that had the police force.
                    This shows that computerised technology has significantly have helped the america police force in reducing crime and clearing crime however they did say that they could only used computerised technology if you used it an advantages and not misuse which i agree because as we have seen before police may have the power or desire to misuse the computerised technology,which is a magnificent disadvantage for all because the police force can trust the individual and it put a bad image on the person and the police force and make people not trust the police force.
                    some of usage is that they used social media for Information,Research and see if there is any wanted person or thing such as the PDF gave information that in 2012 they posted a lost dog and that they received more than 50 000 replies on where the dog was and this meant the dof was found more easily I agree this is right because when looking at social media you pay more attention compared to looking at a post in the town which you may not take heed a lot and that the lost animal could be in different area.
                    Another is that police can detect crimes much faster because if someone posts some post about some suspiciousness then they can find if there is any crime and if so this will be more easily to prevent again if you use some thinking you can not disagree with this if you use your logic in my opinion.
                    Another positive advantage is that this shows when an investigation has finished and been successful this may not be an advantage but does show the police can communicate with the public more faster however this is believed that this is not in the uk but is an example of how it would be positive the uk police force used th

                    <br />
                    Some of the advantages were:
                    There are some benefits in data sharing such as sharing data for suspects.
                    Digital policing will allow the public to speak more easily with the police
                    Transfer data much more quickly which may be vitale such as a car interception
                    This has made the community safe and if you use some logic I will agree with this.
                    Due to increasing amount of computerised technology police have been able to perform drug test ,alcohol test and I agree with this statement this is because I  used to watch police interception using these drug test which has been very vitale to prove that they broken the law however if this machine have an error this will be very unjust because the person did not have any alcohol so they may be  some bias also this has allowed criminal and victims to receive justice.
                    Save time by allowing the computerised technology to eliminate the time. Allowing police to do more community service however this did not say anything on how they did it. But they did say there is a tool called pronto which is believed to save  more than 400 000 thousands hour by changing pen to paper into a phone with important information however we unfortunately do not know how much time was save because how would you measure the time and they did not say this,this means that they may have some bais to this.
                    The ANPR has very  good computerised technology by detecting the plate number of the car.
                    With the help of AI the police force can make the country safer.But again they did not say how they will do this.
                    Cloud may have been the best computerised technology. But they again did not say how.
                    Due to a vast amount of the data this can take a very long time to search and receive the data or to investigate which is obviously a very big disadvantage
                    To solve this problem we can use faster computers or Ai to find the vast amount of data such as google  and chatgpt.
                    Computerised technology increases productivity by decreasing the amount of officers needed for the same amount of work which I agree is a very good advantage and we have seen this advantage before.
                    Also computerised technology helps police force to target the crime and give in the right resources as we can see we have seen this before this advantage.
                    if we can use a more efficient way of using the money for computerised technology we can then use this for getting the advantage of using computerised technology
                    we have seen this advantage before but record crimes which is advantage which is evidence which can be used in the court
                    IF the IT Strategies are successful then we can reduce crime,support the victims and have better communication with the public which is another advantage that I have seen.
                    Another advantage that we have seen is that cloud could massively help the police force to be more organised. Some people said it is future technology. This is in 2013 and we can still see cloud technology being used making the people say this to be correct. also this could save money for the government and the police force
                    another advantage I have seen is that mobile devices now allow knowledge to come to the hand in a matter of seconds
                    Another same advantage is the use of drones however in this they did say  this may cause ethical issues and private issues.but with careful agreement we can resolve these issues for drones.
                    These ethical question everyone will most likely have different opinion so there is probably no solution to this problem
                    another same advantage is that instead of pen and paper work we can use tablets or smartphones
                    <br />                <br />

                    the time and the location and even predict a criminal activity which will massively save time by allowing them to go to the location and know when it is happening.
                    the computerised technology can increase the efficiency and productivity of the police force
                    somehow the computerised technology deters the criminal activity

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    there is places you can report crime online instead of going to the police station
                    The computerised technology automates some of the tasks of the police force which saves time and allows the police force to do something else.
                    another advantage is that we can use computerised technology to identify the future risk using computerised modelling
                    social media we can identify the crime much fas6ter and go to the crime scene much faster as we will know the location
                    We can use fingerprints and cameras to identify the suspects and see what actually happens but if someone hacked the computer then we can not do anything until we find it as being hacked because there is no solution to this.
                    We can use computerised technology to store large vast amounts of data instead of writing which is one of the best advantages.
                    You can use a camera to record the dialog to see what actually happens and with facial recognition we can use it to identify people if they are lying to the police force
