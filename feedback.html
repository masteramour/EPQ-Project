                I hope you have enjoyed this investigation on what are the advantages and disadvantages of using computerised technology in the police force and learned that the advantages of computerised technology are far superior than the disadvnatges of computerised technology however we have learned that there will always be the disadvantages of using computerised technology and that the only possible thing we can do is try to prevent the
                disadvantages as much as possible some of the example are increase the computer machine capability such as using quantum computers and ai to store and recive the vast amount of data by giving the organiasation having a high cyber security use cyptogrpahy of lattice based vectors to prevent the data being seen even if you are haced and that there can not find the data and that for the hacker if they can't decrypt the data then the data is useless for them and this allows that the data is secure this are some of the example of how we could solve or try are best to solve this disadvantages of computerised technology in the police force.
                <br /><br />
                <b> To conclude</b> the advantages of computerised technology is a vast amount while the disadvantages is way smaller than the advantages of computerised technology however they are the disadvantages and the only thing is to try and minimise the effect of the disadvantages of computerised technology.
