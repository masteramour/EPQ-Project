This will help me gain more information about what the advantages and disadvantages of computerised technology are in the police force, and to see if old computerised technology affects the police force efficiency

                                        I'm a police constable for Bedfordshire police I've been a police constable for nine years the first six years I was a Frontline police officer so dealing with the 999 calls going on blue lights and dealing with whatever was in front of me and for the last three years I've been in the recruitment team so I come into schools colleges public events and attract and engage the next generation of police officers to join us.

                                        yeah so that is one of the ranks of policing so when you join policing you start as a police constable and then if you gain promotion you become a sergeant and then an inspector chief inspector superintendent chief superintendent and then it goes even higher than that so Constable is the lowest rank of the peace officer you can be like the military the army I'm forces they have rank system the police of the design can anyone work there yep everybody that joins the police joins as a police constable and then you can either do different roles as a piece Constable so there's different teams you can join so you could become a detective you can work Frontline policing community policing recruitment intelligent or you can gain promotion and become a sergeant inspector and do the same role but sort of in a management level thank you the next question is

                                            So I'll talk about my old role and this role. Okay so in my old role each police officer has a personalised laptop that they're given by the police force and you use that to record crimes that you go to. you use that to take statements, you will use it to input intelligence into the system emails obviously through to different departments different police officers victims of crime people you need to communicate with. it's all running through your laptop or computer system that you're given by the force so that's sort of what you utilise it for on Frontline policing.
                                            <br><br>
                                            In my role now I use it a lot for emails like emailing yourself, contacting yourself but arranging things. I do a lot of Attraction engagement things online so Microsoft teams we use a lot for holding events where people from the public can use the link to log in and we can then present different things for them on Microsoft teams and give them information. That way I will see you use PowerPoints when I come into schools and colleges. I'll have a PowerPoint presentation and I'll use that through my computer to present to the students and the people that I'm trying to talk to .

                                            What are the main advantages of using a computer in the police force?
                                            <br />How have they helped you?

                                            They did yeah so when I when I joined nine years ago they were just transitioning into using laptops more but when I first joined we were still taking statements handwritten so if you were a victim of crime I'd come so let's say you had been burgled I'd come I'd sit down with you I get all the information from you and then I would sit there with a pen and I would write what you're telling me yeah if I went wrong obviously I'd have to start again or cross it out get you to sign it to say that I've crossed it out and then carry on now with laptops when you go to a crime scene you have a proforma sort of on the document on your computer and you basically type their statement so it's a lot quicker it's easy to say if you make a mistake it's easier to rectify and we have a system where we then get the victim to sign the screen so they're still putting their signature to the statement that they've made but it's all electronic and then obviously things don't get missing as much they don't get wet or damage so if I'm somewhere and I'm outside And Dragon software is what we use for people that maybe have dyslexia so there maybe they're typing skills on as as good as somebody that doesn't have dyslexia they're spelling and things like that so instead of them having to type things they have a headset and they will talk into the microphone and the computer will type what they're saying which again is a benefit for some people and now there's light detector so you can see them if they're lying as well yeah so we don't please don't use lie detectors sort of on a normal day-to-day basis it's something that can be utilized in different departments but it's something that it's not it's not a regular current in the place to use lie detectors

                                            The computer does the opposite of making people safe I think technology is dangerous it can be dangerous if used in the wrong way but obviously the police use it in the right way we use it to help victims we use it to you know help safeguard people give people the right information but yeah it can be dangerous if it's in the wrong hands or it's used in the wrong way

                                            I mean obviously always have some sort of software antivirus software which will you know protect you to a certain amount educate yourself on spam fishing emails junk you know all the all the things that sometimes people get tricked into clicking on and it causes in a big problem I'm not massively technical I don't know lots about technology but you know I know the basics and I think everybody should you know be aware enough to know the basics of simple technology and how to sort of stay out of trouble and also no days most people who gets ground are pushing me their elder or the people from migrants because they don't know how to use the technology the best so do you think like adding a like a free lesson to help them do better prevent scamming yeah definitely I think I have seen some some places like local libraries and local councils and stuff sometimes do put on groups or sessions for the people to attend to learn the basics about you know scamming and things I know Bedfordshire police our community teams work closely where we can with people to educate them as best as we can like you say the elderly are susceptible to it more because they didn't grow up with technology so it's coming into their life at the latest stages of their life so a lot of them just believe everything that they see on technology in technology and an email they'll click on a link without really thinking about what the causes could be of it so yeah I think these  lessons would be really beneficial especially to those sort of that are able to be and that have maybe come into the country that haven't had the use of technology before in school they love lessons on scamminks ever since CF3 when I was here I don't remember that the website it was a good website

                                            This is one I saw this struggled to think I mean I've been involved with sort of indecent images of children and things like that you know where children of had photographs taken of the where they shouldn't have and they've been shared and I've had to deal with with the person that was caught doing that I have been to jobs where elderly people have been scammed I went to warm where the someone was I think they'd sent her an email and she'd replied or clicked on the email because they told her that there was a problem with her windows the computer system windows and they'd asked her to type something into a website and that then gave them access to her computer so they were controlling her computer while she was sat there looking and they were able to look at all our passwords they got into a banking and things like that so again she hadn't been educated so I had to go and take details and you know try and help her where I could and sort of help her contact her bank and things like that to make them aware that she'd been been scanned so that's probably the worst one because it affected once you realize she had been scammed I could see that she was really upset by it also together find scammer I didn't but I put all the information I had and all the evidence that she'd given me together and I passed that onto our cyber team and they would have continued that investigation and hopefully they would have found the corporate who was trying to do the scum and we should probably also try to prevent them if they're coming from different countries yeah and this is this is the thing we technology it doesn't have to be somebody down the road or committing the crime in the same town as you it could be from somebody thousands of miles away and that makes it difficult because then obviously the the British police have to contact say the Japanese police or the American and there has to be that sort of cooperative working to say look we've got a victim in the UK we've trapped it that the offender is in America please can you go and do this for us and you know there's a lot of parts that have to fit together to be able to catch the the people and this is why for our safest security test they have to be 100% secure whatever one's wants their success of once they can contain everything and use it but unfortunately you can never be 100% secure it's like a burglar you may put everything Windows glasses gas but they still come somehow yeah

                                        it is ethical to use so we have like a piece of technology it's called mobile ID where we can fingerprint somebody on the street and it sends their fingerprints off via sort of technology to a database and within a few seconds it will come back and tell us if that person has been arrested before and they've given us their fingerprints it will be able to identify them and it will show us a picture of them so that we can then see if they are telling us who they really are so it does work I've used it on the streets when I've sort of stopped someone on the street that was acting suspiciously in the middle of the night I've asked them for their details they've given me their details so just to confirm it was them and they weren't given me false details and because maybe they were wanted burglar or they were up to no good and they didn't want me to know who they were I fingerprinted them and it came back that they were the person that they told me so in that in that sense you know I've used it ethically I've used it for the right reasons obviously it can be misused and that's when it becomes unethical but as long as you're using it how it should be used then yeah I think that it's definitely a tool that is good for the police and you know for the police force are there cameras and walkie talkies yeah in the thing and how good are they so the cameras I think are really good again when I joined they were just being introduced but I've spoken to police officers that didn't have them before and it's to protect the police officer and the member of public that their dealing with because obviously if the camera is on the police officer has to act professionally and do what they should be doing make sure they're doing everything lawful which then protects the member of public but on the other hand if the member of public makes complaint to say that that police officer was rude to them racist sexist whatever it might be and they make an allegation against that police officer that camera can't lie so if that piece officer has been then the evidence is there but if that officer hasn't been and it's a false allegation then that camera protects the police officer just as much as it protects the member of public before them it was very much one person's word against another and you know that's a ways quite dangerous thing isn't it but that camera evidence really does help

                                        yeah definitely without a doubt the like I say the camera situation it protects everybody involved because as soon as you as soon as you get to a job and you start dealing with something you turn that camera on it's the lens in it it's like a  eye lens so it gets a good span of the area as well so and it's got a microphone as well so you can see and hear everything that's going on which is never about thing because it means that the police officers have to do the right thing and acting the right way and it also is reassuring the public that you know it's all being recorded and anything that sort of warrants then to complain will be recorded and been able to look for as evidence so yeah I definitely think it's a good thing that we have them and it's more an advantage than a disadvantage and also do you have the access to all cameras like in the streets because there's many incidents that you have to do someone's camera to see what happened so the CCTV that started around the His Own by the council the police have access to we work closely with the council week work closely with the CCTV operators so in the town centre let's say somebody still something from one of the shops in the town centre let's say B&m in the town centre and they run out that shop and all the town center have radios to the control room so they can call up and say somebody is just run out the shop the six foot blonde hair wearing a red red bomber jacket so

                                        Why are they always disadvantages of using computerized technologies and what are the possibility solution to solve these problems I think they'll always be a disadvantaged to computers because like I say there's always something that might go wrong or you know the operator might not be able to use the right program properly so I think there will always be disadvantages because you can't predict what's going to happen the operator side of sort of problems could be lessened by more education and more help in teaching them how to use technology and obviously as technology gets better hopefully the problem is become less but I think there's always that there's always a chance that the Wi-Fi will drop out or your the program you're using will crash and things like that it's just part of technology isn't it I don't really know how you would solve that the bot from sort of building patches and bug fixes and things like that but again you only need to build a bug fix or a patch when something's gone wrong so I think you'll always gonna have those disadvantages where things will break down and yeah I think it's just more of a proactive way a reactive way of dealing with them when they happen and make sure that that problem doesn't happen again but it doesn't mean that a new problem won't come would

                                        the Advantages of using computerised technology like I say I don't think you're ever gonna have a final solution because I think when you solve a problem at some point down the line they'll always be another problem a different problem that you have to solve so I think you can maybe lessen the problems and as technology becomes greater and the knowledge becomes great I think you may be will be able to lessen the problems that you encounter but I think there's always going to be that element that a problem will occur at some point so I don't think you'll never eradicate it all together but I think the longer that we work with technology in the better technology gets the more likely we are to have less problems and also missed stuff always have that advantages and disadvantages such as computers itself running exercising you could flip you could slip yeah yourself there's always going to be their disadvantages and advantages yeah exactly

                                    <td>
                                        think the advantages are information is stored more safely because it's not on paper in filing cabinets it can be disseminated and sent to people a lot quicker please officers that are using the technology to investigate crimes and deal with victims and things like that it's a lot smoother and there are less problems when you're using technology information can be shared across departments and different police forces and different organizations a lot quicker by using technology rather than having to write a letter or pick up a phone and you know things like that send in an email and things like that it makes things a lot quicker and smoother again there's always a chain so if you send an email and an email get sent on and on and on and on there's a chain all the way back to where it began and people can see that whole chain so there's accountability and a record of what's happened so I think there's some of the advantages like I said the disadvantages I think there's many I think when you're dealing with victims it can become a little less personal when you're using technology rather than writing things down and sort of taking it down manually and
                                        also the disadvantages of technology is if you get hacked or there's a cyber security breach or technology breaks down all together then obviously that's a disadvantage but I'd say the advantages hugely outweigh the disadvantages of using it in the police

                            To Summarise this interview went very well and I learned a lot of knowledge of the police force and what are the advantages and disadvantages of computerised technology and some of the solutions to the disadvantages.
                            However I unfortunately I did not get all my questions answered because this police officer was very honest but did gave me an email to email them so that they can give me the answers to my questions that were not question
                            the only problem was not all my questions were answered but they will be answered shortly from this email customersupport@beds.police.uk to get my answer
                            How could I make the interview better?
                            I think there is no change that I will make if I had an interview with a police officer again.
                            I will use this data to write each section on what are the advantages,disadvantages and the possible solution to this EPQ project.
